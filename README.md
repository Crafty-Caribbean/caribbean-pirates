Table of Contents - You can link to the different sections below
Description - A more detailed outline of the project. What does it do? Is there a high level list of features? If describing a project that has visual features, consider adding pictures or animations of the features and functionality in this section. See Adding Screen Captures below.
Installation - How can another developer get your project up and running on their own? What dependencies are required? Are there environmental requirements? Be specific, and outline steps to take in order to get the project running.
Usage - Further details on how the project is meant to be used may be helpful. For a library or framework, this section would outline how to use the library within another project (see socket.io  ). For a service that is meant to be used within a larger project architecture, instructions on how to integrate may be necessary (see node-statsD  ).
Additionally, for some projects, additional information might make sense.
